The AR Product Viewer is a full-stack web application that enables users to visualize 3D product models in their real environment using WebXR and Augmented Reality (AR) technology.
Built with React (TypeScript) on the frontend and Node.js (Express) with MongoDB on the backend, the system provides a seamless platform for viewing, managing, and interacting with true-to-scale 3D products in a browser—without requiring a dedicated mobile app.

This project demonstrates how immersive AR visualization can enhance the online shopping experience by helping users understand a product’s scale, design, and appearance in their real-world surroundings.
